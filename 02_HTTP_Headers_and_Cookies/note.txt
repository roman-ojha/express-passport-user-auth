*) Cookie:
    -> Small peace of information that improve user Experience
    -> when server response with 'set-cookie' header it will set some cookie to the browser
    -> after that ever request that we make with in the same domain It will attached those cookie which are set base on 'set-cookie' http header
    -> so, after cookies had been set, when we again request then it will set these 'cookies' on the request headers
    -> so when we will request to the server asking web page it will response with 'set-cookie' header Ex:
        => set-cookie: 1P_JAR=2022-11-15-12; expires=Thu, 15-Dec-2022 12:51:03 GMT; path=/; domain=.google.com; Secure; SameSite=none
    -> now after browser get the response it will store these cookies
    -> after that when we again request to the same domain server browser will send these cookies on 'cookies' header
    -> also while responding by the server passing 'set-cookie' as header it also contain the 'expires' data to expires that cookies and no longer store by the browser
